## Description

This is the capstone team project from Epicodus's Introduction to Coding. It creates a website where the user inputs a city and the site returns the most popular cocktail lounges along with a map of their location, and contact information.

Page is unavailable publicly, as detailed in the bug report below.

## Known Bugs
